> By default scripts are not allowed to write files or send or receive communication over a network. To allow scripts to write files and communicate over a network, choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or After Effects > Preferences > General (Mac OS), and select the Allow Scripts To Write Files And Access Network option.

Export the current After Effects comp to FB Keyframes Animation Descriptor JSON document.

> _Requires "**Allow Scripts To Write Files And Access Network**"_

There are two options for exporting, a command line tool and an After Effects plugin.

## 1. Command Line Interface

### How to install
1.  Under this folder run `npm install . -g`

### How to run
1.  Open an After Effects project
2.  Open the comp you want to export
3.  Run `keyframes-cli` in terminal

A file named `${COMP_NAME}.kf.json` should show up under the same folder

## 2. After Effects Plugin

### How to install

1.  Quit After Effects
2.  Move all the files under this folder into your AE Scripts folder
    _e.g. `/Applications/Adobe After Effects CC 2015/Scripts/Keyframes` on macOS_
3.  Launch After Effects
4.  Open an After Effects project
5.  Menu item: **File / Scripts / Keyframes_Exporter.jsx**  
    _The exporter palette window will open_
6.  Press Export

You can keep the palette window open and press Export multiple times.

### How to run

1.  Open an After Effects project
2.  Open the comp you want to export
3.  Menu item: **File / Scripts / Run Script Fileâ€¦**
4.  Choose `Keyframes_Exporter.jsx`
    _The exporter palette window will open_
5.  Press Export

You'll see a bunch of progress messages.
Eventually the folder with the exported JSON will open.
You'll see three new files:

*   `Project.aep.comp-###-Comp Name.kf.json`
    FB Keyframes compatible animation descriptor.

*   `Project.aep.comp-###-Comp Name.json`
    Raw JSON description.

*   `Project.aep.comp-###-Comp Name.log`
    Export progress messages and warnings with timestamps.
    Check this file for warnings about incompatible features.
    Also useful for diagnosing performance issues.
